Repo conventions - 
1. The master branch is the generalized Openmrs module.
2. Client Specific branches are available, and any changes for clients goes into the respective branches and not the master branch.
3. Create a new branch from the client specific base branch and later merge your branch into the client base branch.
4. Merge into master only when the feature is not client specific.
